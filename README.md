# üßæ Product Requirements Prompt

Use the following prompt to generate a **Product Requirements Document (PRD)** for this project:

---
## üìå Prompt for Backend
```
Create a detailed Product Requirements Document (PRD) for a minimalistic Node.js-based API service that integrates with the **Safaricom M-PESA STK Push** payment gateway in a **sandbox environment**.

### üîí Constraints
- All application logic must reside in a single `index.js` file.
- Dependencies and scripts must be defined exclusively in the `package.json` file.

### üöÄ Features to Include

1. **Token Generation Middleware**  
   Securely fetch and inject the OAuth access token required by the Safaricom API using basic authentication.

2. **Payment Endpoint (`/pay`)**  
   Accepts `POST` requests with `phone` and `amount`. Uses environment variables for credentials, constructs a timestamp and password, and initiates a payment request via M-PESA.

3. **Callback Handler (`/callback`)**  
   Handles M-PESA payment confirmations, logs relevant transaction data (Amount, PhoneNumber, MpesaReceiptNumber), and responds to the API.

4. **Environment Configuration**  
   Utilizes `dotenv` for managing credentials like `CONSUMER_KEY`, `SECRET`, `PAYBILL`, and `PASSKEY`.

5. **CORS and Express Middleware**  
   Configured to handle JSON and URL-encoded body data.

6. **Security & Error Handling**  
   Logs and gracefully handles failed token or payment requests.

### üìÑ Output Requirements

- Overview of the application and its purpose
- Functional specifications of each endpoint
- Environment variables used and their role
- Description of the payment flow
- Key dependencies and required versions
- Example request/response for each endpoint
- Expected deployment and usage scenario (e.g., using Ngrok for callbacks in development)

```
### Prompt for Frontend
```
Generate a detailed Product Requirements Document (PRD) for a React-based web application called **Coffee Kiosk** that enables users to purchase coffee using Safaricom M-PESA STK Push. The app features a simple UI for displaying coffee products and a modal payment form triggered on "Buy with M-PESA."

The PRD should include the following sections:

---

### 1. üìå Overview
Provide a brief description of the app and its purpose.

### 2. üéØ Goals and Objectives
Describe what this app aims to achieve.

### 3. ‚ú® Core Features
- Display coffee products with image, name, and price.
- Modal form to input Safaricom phone number.
- M-PESA STK Push payment triggered via API call to backend.
- Phone number validation (accepts 07XXXXXXXX, +2547XXXXXXXX, 2547XXXXXXXX formats).
- Responsive UI with header, navigation, product grid, and footer.

### 4. üîÑ User Flow
Explain the flow from selecting a product to completing a payment.

### 5. ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Stack
- **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Node.js (running on `localhost:3000`) with `/pay` endpoint
- **Networking:** Axios for HTTP requests

### 6. üîå API Interaction
- Endpoint: `POST /pay`
- Payload: `{ phone: string, amount: number }`
- Expected behavior: STK Push triggered and confirmation alert shown to user.

### 7. ‚ùó Validation & Error Handling
- Validate phone number input format.
- Display alerts for invalid input.
- Use try-catch blocks to catch and display API errors with friendly messages.

### 8. üé® UI/UX Requirements
- Clean and minimal interface.
- Modal popup for entering phone number.
- Loading indicator during API call.
- Consistent color theme (green for actions, gray for neutral elements).

### 9. üìå Assumptions & Constraints
- Backend must be running and properly configured for M-PESA sandbox.
- Only Kenyan Safaricom numbers are supported.
- Product pricing is static and defined client-side.

# M-PESA STK Push API Service

A minimalistic Node.js API for integrating with Safaricom's M-PESA STK Push service in sandbox mode.

## Features

- STK Push payment initiation
- Payment callback handling
- OAuth token management
- Environment-based configuration
- CORS enabled
- Error handling and logging

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Safaricom Developer Account credentials
- ngrok (for local development)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd mpesa-stk-push-api
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:
   ```env
   PORT=3000
   CONSUMER_KEY=your_consumer_key
   CONSUMER_SECRET=your_consumer_secret
   PASSKEY=your_lipa_na_mpesa_passkey
   PAYBILL=174379
   CALLBACK_URL=https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok.io/callback
   ```

4. Start ngrok (in a separate terminal):
   ```bash
   ngrok http 3000
   ```

5. Update the `CALLBACK_URL` in your `.env` file with the ngrok URL.

## Running the Server

Development mode (with auto-reload):
```bash
npm run dev
```

Production mode:
```bash
npm start
```

## API Endpoints

### 1. Initiate Payment
```http
POST /pay
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "phone": "254712345678",
    "amount": 100
}
```

### 2. Payment Callback
```http
POST /callback
```
Automatically handles M-PESA payment confirmations.

### 3. Health Check
```http
GET /health
```

## Testing

1. Start the server and ngrok
2. Use Postman or any HTTP client to send a payment request:
   ```http
   POST http://localhost:3000/pay
   Content-Type: application/json

   {
       "phone": "254712345678",
       "amount": 100
   }
   ```
3. Monitor the server logs for callback information

## Error Handling

The API includes comprehensive error handling for:
- Invalid requests
- M-PESA API errors
- OAuth token generation failures
- Callback processing errors

## Security Notes

- Never commit your `.env` file
- Use HTTPS in production
- Validate all incoming requests
- Monitor logs for suspicious activities
