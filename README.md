# Build a homepage for a coding learning web app called "CodeSprint".

Requirements:

 **Authentication:**
- Skip authentication completely for now.
- Include a non-functional "Login" button at the top right corner as a placeholder (no redirect or login form).

 **Layout and Navigation:**
- Use a sidebar on the left with navigation sections: 
  - "Dashboard"
  - "Lessons"
  - "Challenges"
  - "Projects"
  - "Leaderboard"
  - "My Progress"
- The sidebar should be collapsible on smaller screens.
- Top bar includes the app name/logo on the left, and "Login" button and user avatar placeholder on the right.

 **Main Content (Default/Home View):**
- Centered welcome section:
  - Large welcoming text: "Welcome to CodeSprint"
  - Subtext: "Master the skills to build the future. Start your coding journey with curated tracks and hands-on projects."
  - "Start Learning" button (takes user to Lessons section if routing is active).
- Below the welcome, display **service offerings as interactive cards** with icons:
  - Web Development
  - Database Development
  - Dart with Flutter
  - AI for Software Engineering
  - Startup Building for Software Developers

 **Design Guidelines:**
- Use a clean, modern look with Tailwind CSS.
- Prefer rounded corners, soft shadows, and a blue-accented color palette.
- Typography should be elegant and clear.
- Must be mobile responsive with appropriate layout adaptation.

 **Lessons Preview Section:**
- Show a horizontal scroll of lesson preview cards.
- Each card includes:
  - Lesson title
  - Short description
  - Difficulty level (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced)
  - Progress bar showing % completion (use static data for now)

 **Extra Features:**
- Include a section labeled "My Progress" showing 3 horizontal progress bars:
  - Overall Platform Progress
  - Current Track Progress
  - Weekly Goal Completion
- Add icons and a consistent visual language across the app.

Notes:
- All routing, login, and data should be placeholder or static.
- Focus is on design, layout, and intuitive learning UI.


4. **Generate, Preview, and Customize**  
   Export the code, deploy it, or test it using Expo Go.
